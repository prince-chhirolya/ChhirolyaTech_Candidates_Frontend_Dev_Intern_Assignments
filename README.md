# GitBook Clone

This is a simple clone of **GitBook** developed using **React**. The project is designed to showcase product documentation with a modern user interface, complete with a hero section, announcement banner, and fullscreen sections. It includes a responsive layout, sliders, interactive elements, and a sidebar navigation feature to simulate the GitBook experience.

## Features

- **Responsive Layout:** The design is fully responsive, meaning it works well on devices ranging from mobile phones to desktops.
- **Interactive Hero Section:** Includes a GitHub sign-up button and a free trial start button for users to interact with.
- **Full-screen Sections:** Sections that showcase additional content and interactable features.
- **Announcement Banner:** A prominent notification bar at the top of the page highlighting important updates.
- **Slider Components:** Interactive sliders to display images and text content in a dynamic way.
- **Sidebar Navigation:** A floating sidebar on the right-hand side, providing quick and intuitive access to different sections of the documentation with active section highlighting and interactive icons.

## Technologies Used

- **React** for building the UI components.
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling.
